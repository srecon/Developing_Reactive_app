= Istio Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

[IMPORTANT]
.Before Start
====
You should have NO virtualservice, destinationrule, gateway or policy (in `tutorial` namespace) `kubectl get virtualservice` `kubectl get destinationrule` `kubectl get gateway` `kubectl get policy`
if so run:

[.console-input]
[source, bash]

In this chapter, we are going to see how to use Istio's authorization feature to provide access control for services in an Istio Mesh.

[#enabling-rbac]
== Enabling RBAC

The first thing to do is enable Istio Authorization by using `ClusterRbacConfig` object.

[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kubectl create -f link:{github-repo}/{istiofiles-dir}/authorization-enable-rbac.yml[istiofiles/authorization-enable-rbac.yml] -n tutorial
----

Now RBAC is enabled on your mesh.
Run next command:

[.console-input]
[source, bash ,subs="+macros,+attributes" ]
----
curl http://istio-ingressgateway-istio-system.{appdomain}/{path}
----

[.console-output]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
RBAC: access denied
----

By default, Istio uses a _deny by default_ strategy, meaning that nothing is permitted until you explicitly define access control policy to grant access to any service.

[#authorization-jwt]
== Authorization and JWT

In this section, you'll learn how to use a JWT claim to manage the access to the services.

The first thing you need to do is applying all the steps described at xref:8jwt.adoc[End-user authentication with JWT] section so you enable JWT authentication logic inside the mesh.

After that, you are ready to use JWT in the authorization phase as well.

Now apply next Istio resource which makes that only tokens that contain a field named `role` with value `customer`.

[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kubectl create -f link:{github-repo}/{istiofiles-dir}/namespace-rbac-policy-jwt.yml[istiofiles/namespace-rbac-policy-jwt.yml] -n tutorial
----

and then you can do a new call with the new token containing the `role` claim with value `customer``:

[.console-input]
[source, bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
token=$(curl https://gist.githubusercontent.com/lordofthejars/f590c80b8d83ea1244febb2c73954739/raw/21ec0ba0184726444d99018761cf0cd0ece35971/token.role.jwt -s)
----

:extrap: -H "Authorization: Bearer $token"
include::curl_params.adoc[]

[.console-output]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
customer => preference => recommendation v1 from 'recommendation-v1-b4d67bcb7-7rp88': 4
----

Notice that now only valid JWT tokens containing the claim `role` set to `customer` will suceed, the rest you'll get an access denied.

To validate that this is working correctly, do next thing:

Open `istiofiles/namespace-rbac-policy-jwt.yml` and change the `role` with value `xxx` and save the file.

[.console-input]
[source, yaml]
.istiofiles/namespace-rbac-policy-jwt.yml
----
when:
  - key: request.auth.claims[role]
    values: ["xxxx"]
----

And then replace it:

[.console-input]
[source, bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kubectl replace -f link:{github-repo}/{istiofiles-dir}/namespace-rbac-policy-jwt.yml[istiofiles/namespace-rbac-policy-jwt.yml] -n tutorial
----

After that, repeat the same request as before:

:extrap: -H "Authorization: Bearer $token"
include::curl_params.adoc[]

[.console-output]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
RBAC: access denied
----

But notice that now the access is denied because the `role` field value in the token is `customer` instead of `xxx`.

[#final-notes]
== Final Notes

In this chapter you've seen how to RBAC.
Obviously, you should also enable mTLS to authenticate also your requests.

Check xref:8mTLS.adoc[mTLS section] to learn more about mTLS and Istio.

[#cleanup]
== Clean Up

Follow xref:8jwt.adoc#cleanup[End-user authentication with JWT Clean Up] steps there to clean all JWT stuff and then call:

[.console-input]
[source, bash]
----
kubectl delete -f istiofiles/namespace-rbac-policy-jwt.yml -n tutorial
----

[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kubectl delete -f istiofiles/authorization-enable-rbac.yml -n tutorial
