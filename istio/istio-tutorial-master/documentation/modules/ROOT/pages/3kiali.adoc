= Observing microservice meshes with Kiali
include::_attributes.adoc[]

At some point when you are developing your microservice architecture, you will
need to visualize what is happening in your service mesh. You will have
questions like “Which service is connected to which other service?” and “How
much traffic goes to each microservice?” But because of the loosely tied nature
of microservice architectures , these questions can be difficult to answer.

Those are the kinds of question that Kiali has the ability to answer, by giving
you a big picture of the mesh, and showing the whole flow of your requests and
data.

Kiali builds upon the same concepts as Istio, and you can check the
link:https://www.kiali.io/documentation/glossary/concepts/[glossary] for a
refresher.

[#howkiali]
== How does Kiali work?

Kiali taps into the data provided by Istio and OpenShift to generate its
visualizations. It fetches ingress data (such as request tracing with Jaeger),
the listing and data of the services, health indexes, and so on.

Kiali runs as a service together with Istio, and does not require any changes
to Istio or Openshift configuration (besides the ones required to install
Istio).

// Workshop address

So now we can access Kiali, so
let's do it:

The default credentials are "admin/admin", but it's recommended to change them
before using it in production.

[#generatingdata]
== Generating Sample Data

To show the capabilities of Kiali, you'll need an Istio-enabled application to
be running. For this, we can use the `customer-tutorial` application we created
earlier.

To generate data for it, we can `curl` it with this command:

include::curl.adoc[]

[#servicegraph]
== Service Graph

After you login, you should see the Service Graph page:

image:kiali-service-graph.png[Service Graph Page]

It shows a graph with all the microservices, connected by the requests going
through then. On this page, you can see how the services interact with each
other.

[#applications]
== Applications

Click the `Applications` link in the left navigation. On this page you can
view a listing of all the services that are running in the cluster, and
additional information about them, such as health status.

image:kiali-application-list.png[Application Listing Page]

Click on the "customer" application to see its details:

image:kiali-application-details.png[Service Details]

By hovering the icon on the Health section, you can see the health of a service
(a service is considered healthy) when it's online and responding to requests
without errors:

By clicking on `Outbound Metrics` or `Inbound Metrics`, you can also see the
metrics for an application, like so:

[#workloads]
== Workloads

Click the `Workloads` link in the left navigation. On this page you can view
a listing of all the workloads are present on your applications. 

image:kiali-workload-list.png[Workload Listing]

Click on the `customer` workload. Here you can see details for the workload,
such as the pods and services that are included in it:

image:kiali-workload-details.png[Workload Details]

By clicking `Outbound Metrics` and `Inbound Metrics`, you can check the
metrics for the workload. The metrics are the same as the `Application` ones.

[#services]
== Services

Click on the `Services` link in the left navigation. Here, you can see the
listing of all services.

image:kiali-service-list.png[Service Listing]

Click on the `customer` service. You can, on this page, see the details of
the service, such as metrics, traces, workloads, virtual services,
destination rules and so on:
